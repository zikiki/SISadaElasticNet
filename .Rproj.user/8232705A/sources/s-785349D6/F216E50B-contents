\title{SIS.gaussian
%%  ~~function to do ... ~~
}
\description{SIS is used to select relevant variables from Ultra-high dimensional dataset. SIS ranks the importance of features according to their magnitude of marginal regression coefficients.
%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~
}
\usage{
SIS.gaussian(x, y, pred, scale = F)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{data matrix of regressor candidates, NAs and Inf are not allowed. Each row corresponds to an observation.
}
  \item{y}{a vector of n continuouse dependent variables.
}
  \item{pred}{number of relevant variable to select, pred has to be lower than p.
}
  \item{scale}{scale If scale=TRUE, X will be standardized.
}
